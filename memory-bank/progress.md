# Progress: What Works & What's Left

## What Works ‚úÖ

### Core Functionality
- **Friend Follow Flow**: Automatic diagnostic start when user follows bot
- **Diagnostic Questions**: 3-step QuickReply sequence (subsidy ‚Üí amount ‚Üí rent)
- **Results Display**: Rich Flex message with subsidy calculation and visual design
- **AI Chat Mode**: Seamless transition to Cerebras-powered chat after diagnostic
- **State Management**: Persistent user state across interactions using Cloudflare KV

### Restart Mechanisms
- **Command Restart**: "Ë®∫Êñ≠", "Ë®∫Êñ≠ÈñãÂßã", "/diagnostic" restart diagnostic flow
- **Button Restart**: "Ë®∫Êñ≠„Çí„ÇÑ„ÇäÁõ¥„Åô" button in results message
- **Mode Recovery**: Graceful handling when users text during diagnostic mode

### Technical Infrastructure
- **Webhook Handling**: Proper LINE signature validation and event processing
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with user-friendly error messages
- **Logging**: Detailed console logs for production monitoring and debugging
- **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript coverage with strict mode compliance

### Code Quality
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation into 8 focused files
- **Linting Compliance**: All Biome rules satisfied
- **Performance**: Optimized with early returns and parallel processing
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive Memory Bank established

## What's Left to Build üîÑ

### Deployment & Integration
1. **Production Deployment**: Deploy to Cloudflare Workers production environment
2. **LINE Webhook Setup**: Configure LINE bot webhook URL to point to deployed worker
3. **Environment Variables**: Set all required secrets in Cloudflare environment
4. **LIFF Integration**: Replace placeholder URL with actual Zoom booking system

### Testing & Validation
1. **End-to-End Testing**: Complete user journey testing in production
2. **Load Testing**: Verify performance under concurrent user load
3. **Error Scenario Testing**: Test various failure modes and recovery paths
4. **User Acceptance**: Real user testing of diagnostic flow and AI chat

### Enhancements (Future Iterations)
1. **Analytics Integration**: User behavior tracking and metrics
2. **Enhanced Diagnostics**: More sophisticated subsidy calculation algorithms
3. **Personalization**: User preferences and history-based recommendations
4. **Multi-language Support**: English language option for international users

## Current Status: Ready for Production üöÄ

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- ‚úÖ All code compiled and linted
- ‚úÖ TypeScript strict mode compliance
- ‚úÖ Error handling implemented
- ‚úÖ Logging system in place
- ‚úÖ State management tested
- ‚úÖ Memory Bank documentation complete

### Deployment Dependencies
- Cloudflare Workers account with KV namespace
- LINE Developer Console configuration
- Cerebras API key access
- Environment variable configuration

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Technical Limitations
- **Chat History**: Limited to 10 messages for performance
- **LIFF Placeholder**: Booking URL not yet connected to real system
- **Subsidy Calculation**: Basic calculation, could be more sophisticated

### Monitoring Needs
- Real-time error tracking in production
- User engagement metrics and analytics
- Performance monitoring for response times
- KV storage usage tracking

## Success Metrics to Track
1. **Diagnostic Completion Rate**: Percentage of users completing full 3-step flow
2. **AI Chat Engagement**: Users continuing to chat after diagnostic
3. **Restart Usage**: Frequency of diagnostic restarts per user
4. **Error Rates**: System reliability and error recovery effectiveness
5. **Response Times**: End-to-end performance metrics
