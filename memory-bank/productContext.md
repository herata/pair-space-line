# Product Context: PairSpace LINE Bot

## Why This Project Exists
Housing search in Japan is complex, especially regarding subsidies and financial assistance. Many people don't know about available housing subsidies or how to calculate their actual rental costs. PairSpace LINE Bot solves this by providing an accessible, conversational interface for housing guidance.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Subsidy Awareness Gap**: People don't know what housing subsidies they qualify for
2. **Complex Calculations**: Difficult to understand real rental costs after subsidies
3. **Information Accessibility**: Housing information is scattered across multiple sources
4. **Guidance Availability**: Need for immediate, 24/7 housing consultation

## How It Should Work

### User Journey
1. **Discovery**: User adds bot as friend on LINE
2. **Assessment**: Immediate diagnostic flow starts automatically
3. **Results**: Rich visual display of subsidy potential and rental impact
4. **Guidance**: Transition to AI chat for detailed questions and advice
5. **Re-engagement**: Easy restart of diagnostic for different scenarios

### User Experience Goals
